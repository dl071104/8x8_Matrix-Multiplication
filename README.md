# 8x8_Matrix-Multiplication
<br>
 Designed and implemented an 8Ã—8 matrix multiplier in Verilog using a systolic array for efficient spatial data flow. Leveraged parallelism and dual-port memory to improve throughput and reduce latency. Achieved timing closure by analyzing and correcting setup/hold violations.
