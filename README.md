# 8x8_Matrix-Multiplication
<br>
Designed and implemented an 8Ã—8 matrix multiplier in Verilog using a systolic array for efficient spatial data flow. Leveraged parallelism and dual-port memory to improve throughput and reduce latency. Achieved timing closure by analyzing and correcting setup/hold violations.
<br>
MAC: Synthesizable model for a MAC (Multiply Accumulator) <br>
Task2: Matrix Multiplication of two 8x8 matrices by instantiating a single MAC, total cycle is 518 <br>
Task3: One Dual-Port memory and two MACs, total cycle is 267 <br>
Task4: Optimization, reduce to 83 cycles. <br>
ExtraCredit: 8x8 systolic Array Based Matrix Multiplication, 22 cycles. <br>
